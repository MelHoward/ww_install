WeBWorK Install Script

The goal of the ww_install.pl script is to install WeBWorK on a variety of linux-based systems.  For systems based on Debian (Ubuntu, etc.), Red Hat Linux (Fedora, CentOS, Scientific Linux) and SUSE, it will attempt to install the prerequisites.  Other systems will need to have these prerequisites already installed.

On compatible systems, simply run the following command:
sudo perl ww_install.pl

It has been lightly tested on

Fedora 17 (11/20/2012)
Ubuntu 12.04 (11/20/2012)

where it did in fact install webwork.
